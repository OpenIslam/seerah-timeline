Seerah Timeline
===============

A timeline of the biography of the prophet Muhammed &#65018; (PBUH).

## Motivation
The biography of the prophet Muhammed &#65018; (PBUH) is very well documented in books but little can be found online to quickly and easily learn.
Through this initiative, we hope to provide, to Muslims and non-Muslims alike, a look at the life of the prophet Muhammed &#65018; (PBUH) through a simple to use interface.

## Sources
The main (at least for the start) source for this project will be the book **The Sealed Nectar ( [الرحيق المختوم]( https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%AD%D9%8A%D9%82_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AE%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%85) )**.
It has been chosen for it's simplicity and availability in different languages.
